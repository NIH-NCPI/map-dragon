# Map Dragon
<<<<<<< HEAD

Map Dragon is a tool for data mappers that enables users to import and store data dictionaries, search and map across multiple ontologies simultaneously, and export mapped data. This will standardize terminology for improved use in the AnVIL Data Explorer, and improve cross-platform querying.

MapDragon operates on GCP and has been tested for use in Chrome and Microsoft Edge. We do not recommend using MapDragon on other browsers.
